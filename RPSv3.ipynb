    "Having just read the book, \"The Man Who Solved The Markets: How Jim Simons Launched The Quant Revolution\", I've become interested in the applications of pattern recognition in financial markets. While the book remains far more of a biography than an analysis of algorithmic trading strategies, it still mentions a few of the mathematical tools Simons employed to grow the Medallion Fund. One such tool is Markov models, which describe mathematical systems that hop from one \"state\" (a situation or set of values) to another. Markov models are complex systems and trying to implement one here remains far beyond my elementary coding abilities. That said, I have decided to try and get to grips with the basics of AI / pattern recognition by applying similar principles to the very simple game: Rock, Paper, Scissors."

    "To judge what is most likely to be played in the 21st hand, we can start by looking at the 20th, Rock, and see what the distribution of hands played following a Rock is. From there, we can look at the combination of the 19th and 20th hand, Scissors then Rock, and see what the distribution of hands played following a Scissors then a Rock. We can then train the code to repeat this process for all patterns in length up to half of the total length of the list of hands already played.\n",

    "For each round of 'next hand guessing', we will be able to return a table showing, 1. The pattern preceding the next (unknown hand), whether that pattern is either the last hand played or a sequence of the last 20 hands, 2. The amount of times this pattern has come up in the game so far, excluding this instance, and 3. Most importantly, the percentage distribution of Rock / Paper / Scissors that has been played following instances in which this pattern has previously appeared.\n",

    "This strategy in of itself is by no means advanced, however there are certain approaches we can take to develop it further. First, we need a way to combine all the columns / patterns in deciding what hand to play next. To do that, we can convert the % figures back to integers. For each hand (R, P or S), we can then add up how many times each has come up in each pattern. Using a sum function, we can decide which hand to play. The output would look as follows. "
